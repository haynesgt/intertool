I see some potential in developing tools to do various code generation tasks. For example, if you can convert Java code to a more general data form such as relational (SQL) data, JSON, or XML, then you can do synthesis and analysis with that data.

Use cases:

- I have constants in Java files, and I want them in non-Java programs
- I have Dto / Pojo models, and I want them in other languages
- I want to anylise the complexity of Java code
- I want to run queries to find code
- I want to convert Java logic into other languages
- I want to create graphs of Java code

Similar cases exist with languages other than Java.
